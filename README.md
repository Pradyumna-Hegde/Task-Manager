## Details
#### UI 
The Task Manager application provides a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The user can also view a list of all tasks and mark them as completed or pending. 

#### Custom APIs
The application's functionality is powered by a set of custom-built APIs that perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the database.

#### Express as Middleware
Express.js is used as a middleware framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. The application also includes custom async-wrapper and error handling code to ensure that the app is stable and reliable. These custom codes help handle errors in a more efficient way and make sure that the application is not crashing in the event of a failure.

#### Database
The Task Manager application uses MongoDB as its primary database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides flexibility in storing and retrieving data, which is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data. This allows for easy scaling of the application as the database can handle an increased load of data.


In Summary, **Task Manager** is a feature-rich and user-friendly application that provides users with an efficient and effective way to manage their tasks. With its modern technology stack and robust backend, Task Manager is a reliable and scalable application that can meet the needs of a wide range of users.
